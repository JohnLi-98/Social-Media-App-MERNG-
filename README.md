# Social Media App

A single page application that is similar to Twitter. It allows you to create posts on a timeline for users to interact with.

## Motivation

This project uses the MERNG stack, which was of interest to me because both the backend and frontend could be done with just the JavaScript language. I had not used this stack before and was unfamiliar with it but this project allowed me to learn more about it.

## Technologies/Frameworks Used

- MongoDB (Atlas)
- Express
- React
- Node
- GraphQL

## Features

- Login and Registration functionality.
- Timeline of user posts.
- Creation of post if authenticated.
- Editing and deletion of own posts.
- Interact with posts (like and comment).
- Viewing a post thread.

## Demo

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://my-social-media-app.netlify.app/). **NOTE:** This is a personal project and although security implications have been considered and enforced (bcrypt/jwt), personal sensitive data should **NEVER** be entered while using this application. It is recommended that temporary data (data to be discarded after use) should be entered instead to prevent any potential threat of intruders.

## Credits

This project was inspired by [hidjou](https://github.com/hidjou), who created a tutorial for this project and gave an extensive teaching of this technical stack.
